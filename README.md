# CS303_Assignment3
Infix to Postfix conversion and Queue implentation
This Program consist of two parts. One is an Infix to Postfix conversion. The other sets up a Queue using a singly linked list.
The main menu is as follows:

To start, let's start Part 1. We'll add a formula. Operators to be considered are +, â€“, *, /, %.

If we are to enter an equation that does not have a closing parenthesis, then we will get an error:

Similarly, if we do not have an opening bracket, an error will also be thrown. Position starts from zero.

For part 2, we have a Queue using a singly linked list. First we'll check to make sure it is empty to start:

Next we'll add a number:

Confirming it is there:

Next I'll add a few more:

Now we can view the numbers and make sure it matches our first one:

As expected, it matches our 6039. Now I'll pop that and the mystery of the next number I added will be solved:

As we can see, there are now only three integers in the queue:

Finally after popping the rest from the queue, if we try to pop again, we will get a message indicating that it is already empty.
